# Intelligent Video Analytics : Real-Time Person Detection and Tracking
Real-time multi-person tracking system combining YOLOv8 for detection and DeepSORT for identity-preserving tracking. Includes a Streamlit interface for video upload, webcam input, ID selection, and processed video preview.This project is an interactive web application for real-time person detection and tracking in videos, built with Streamlit, YOLOv8, and DeepSORT.
The application allows users to upload a video file or use a live webcam stream to detect and track individuals throughout the video. Using YOLOv8 for object detection and DeepSORT for multi-object tracking, each person in the scene is assigned a unique, persistent ID. This enables the system to follow individuals consistently across frames, even in crowded environments.

The app provides an intuitive workflow:

Scan Mode ‚Äì Analyze the first few frames of a video to automatically detect and collect all person IDs.

Selection Mode ‚Äì Choose to track all detected individuals or focus on a single person by selecting their ID.

Tracking Mode ‚Äì Process the entire video, overlay bounding boxes and IDs, and save the annotated output.

With a modern custom-designed Streamlit interface, the app includes progress indicators, real-time previews, and session controls for a smooth user experience.

This tool is useful for:

üé• Video analytics ‚Äì Tracking individuals in recorded surveillance or CCTV footage.

üß™ Research and experiments ‚Äì Computer vision projects requiring person re-identification.

üéì Education ‚Äì Demonstrating the practical integration of deep learning models in real-world tracking tasks.

‚öôÔ∏è Prototyping ‚Äì Building blocks for larger intelligent video analysis systems.

By default, the application uses yolov8n.pt, a lightweight model optimized for CPU-based systems, ensuring broad compatibility. On GPU-enabled platforms, larger models (yolov8s, yolov8m, etc.) can be used for higher accuracy.
