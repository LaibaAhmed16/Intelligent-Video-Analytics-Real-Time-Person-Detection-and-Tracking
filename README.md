# Intelligent Video Analytics : Real-Time Person Detection and Tracking
Real-time multi-person tracking system combining YOLOv8 for detection and DeepSORT for identity-preserving tracking. Includes a Streamlit interface for video upload, webcam input, ID selection, and processed video preview.This project is an interactive web application for real-time person detection and tracking in videos, built with Streamlit, YOLOv8, and DeepSORT.

This project is an interactive web application for real-time person detection and tracking in videos, built with **Streamlit**, **YOLOv8**, and **DeepSORT**.

The application allows users to:
- Upload a video file or use a live webcam stream  
- Detect and track individuals throughout the video  
- Assign unique, persistent IDs to each person using YOLOv8 (object detection) + DeepSORT (multi-object tracking)  
- Follow individuals consistently across frames, even in crowded environments

## üöÄ Workflow

The app provides an intuitive workflow:

1. **Scan Mode** ‚Äì Analyze the first few frames of a video to automatically detect and collect all person IDs.  
2. **Selection Mode** ‚Äì Choose to track all detected individuals or focus on a single person by selecting their ID.  
3. **Tracking Mode** ‚Äì Process the entire video, overlay bounding boxes and IDs, and save the annotated output.  

## üíª Hardware & Model Compatibility

| Platform              | Recommended Model            | GPU Support | Notes                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CPU-only PC/Laptop** | `yolov8n.pt`                 | ‚ùå          | Works fine (~10‚Äì15 FPS, lightweight model optimized for CPUs).        |
| **Desktop w/ GPU**     | `yolov8s.pt` or `yolov8m.pt` | ‚úÖ CUDA     | Best performance, smoother detection, and higher accuracy.            |
| **Jetson Nano**        | `yolov8n.pt`                 | ‚úÖ CUDA     | Achieves near real-time performance with lightweight models.          |
| **Raspberry Pi**       | `yolov8n` (exported to NCNN) | ‚ùå CPU only | Limited FPS, suitable for demos but not heavy real-time applications. |

‚ö° **Default model in this project:** `yolov8n.pt` (fastest & most efficient for general use).  
üìå *Performance depends on hardware specs, model size, and video resolution.*
